Crypto_ParadoxOS Whitepaper

This document introduces Crypto_ParadoxOS, an innovative computational system designed to resolve paradoxes through recursive transformation until an equilibrium state is reached.

We present a framework that transcends traditional approaches to paradoxical problems by embracing both convergent recursive resolution and divergent informational expansion.

The system demonstrates capabilities in resolving numerical, matrix-based, and textual paradoxes through a combination of fixed-point iteration, eigenvalue stabilization, and contradiction resolution techniques.
