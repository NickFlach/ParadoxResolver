Crypto_ParadoxOS Yellow Paper

This paper presents the formal specification and technical implementation details of Crypto_ParadoxOS, a recursive paradox-resolution system.

We provide mathematical foundations for the transformation rules, convergence properties, and evolutionary mechanisms that drive the system.

We introduce formal definitions for paradox states, transformation functions, and convergence criteria, along with proofs of termination and stability properties.
